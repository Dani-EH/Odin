        <h3>This 4-ingredient pesto tortellini bake packs a lot of flavor for very little effortâ€”a package of tri-color cheese tortellini, a smidge of prosciutto, prepared pesto, and shredded mozzarella are all you need. It's a nice weeknight baked pasta to serve with a green salad.</h3>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (9 ounce) package tri-color cheese tortellini</li>
            <li>1 cup prepared pesto</li>
            <li>2 slices prosciutto, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in tortellini and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Stir tortellini, prosciutto, pesto, and 1/2 cup mozzarella together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour into a baking dish. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden, about 10 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
